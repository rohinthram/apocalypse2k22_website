A simple website for event management

Events can be created from people can register for it.

For developer, create and maintain the event details as below

Open .json files to update necessary info

update the event types
then for each element of event types
have a json ; like the tech_events.json and non_tech_events.json

Once the events are over, update the **registration number** in the *event_results.json* to have their detail populated in the website

Note: Please do not alter the json structure, it may the code to not function as desired

This code requires a valid token for Gmail API to function, or else it may cause failure of the mailing service
